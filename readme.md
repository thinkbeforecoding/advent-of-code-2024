# AdventOfCode in F# an Uiua

The code has been moved to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/thinkbeforecoding/advent-of-code-2024

This is this time of the year again. [F#](https://fsharp.org) is still my favorite language to quickly solve 
the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. The interactive mode is awesome to scaffold code
and test continuously. The type checking signals early missteps, and the execution is fast.

And I'm starting to be more fluent in [uiua](https://www.uiua.org), this super nice general purpose, stack-based, array-oriented programming language ! Check the language web site to see the awsome things you can do.

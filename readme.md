# AdventOfCode in F# 

This is this time of the year again. [F#](https://fsharp.org) is still my favorite language to quickly solve 
the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. The interactive mode is awesome to scaffold code
and test continuously. The type checking signals early missteps, and the execution is fast.
